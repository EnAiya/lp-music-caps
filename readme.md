# LP-MusicCaps: LLM-Based Pseudo Music Captioning

This is a implementation of [LP-MusicCaps: LLM-Based Pseudo Music Captioning](#). This project aims to generate captions for music. 1) Tag-to-Caption: Using existing tags, We leverage the power of OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo API to generate high-quality and contextually relevant captions based on music tag. 2) Audio-to-Caption: Using music-audio and pseudo caption pairs, we train a cross-model encoder-decoder model for end-to-end music captioning
